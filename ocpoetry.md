Hello!

Your critiques are fine for /r/OCPoetry, which is great for that community, but they're not up to the standards of /r/ThePoetryWorkshop.

If you show us that you're willing and able to write **200 to 400 words** (half a page to a page) that **engage thoughtfully and specifically** with **another poet's work**, then we'll gladly let you into TPW, where you will receive that level of engagement yourself.

We cannot emphasize enough that the content is more important than the length. **Do not use AI**---you wouldn't be the first, and we can tell.

Please reach out again with a link to such a critique. Thank you!
