So /r/ThePoetryWorkshop is for poets with some workshopping experience.

The good news is that you can get that experience on /r/OCPoetry, especially on the posts marked “Workshop.” Take a look at their feedback guide:

https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques/

If you show us that you’re willing and able to write **200 to 400 words** (half a page to a page) that **engage thoughtfully and specifically** with **another poet’s work**, then we’ll gladly let you into TPW, where you will receive that level of engagement yourself.

We cannot emphasize enough that the content is more important than the length. **Do not use AI**—you wouldn’t be the first, and we can tell.

Please reach out again with a link to such a critique. Thank you!
