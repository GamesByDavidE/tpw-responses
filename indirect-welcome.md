Great, welcome!

A word about our rules: While we appreciate comments of any length, the only ones that count with respect to our leave-one-take-one system are on /r/ThePoetryWorkshop and meet the above guidelines. This high standard benefits everyone, including you. Thank you!

For each of your own poems, you must link to one of your eligible comments that you have not previously used for this purpose, ideally in the post itself, though a reply is OK.
